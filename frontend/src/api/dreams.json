These are large and low-income families, families in difficult life circumstances, and IDP families. Each family has its own complicated story. We want to help them overcome temporary difficulties and provide our beneficiaries with food packages that will consist of sausages, butter, oil, buckwheat, rice, different types of chicken meat, fresh fruit, sweets and much more. The cost of one food set is UAH 1,500.\r\n\r\nWe ask everyone who cares to support our project with any amount of money!

This is the first zoo in Ukraine (founded in 1895), and also one of the twenty oldest in the world.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the value of the collection, the zoo ranks second in Ukraine — after the Kyiv Zoo. More than 384 species of animals are preserved in the zoological park, which is 8 thousand individuals, including fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, mammals, etc.\r\n\r\nOur goal is to provide the zoo with 1,500 kg of meat (approximately 100 kg of meat is needed per day to feed the animals). The zoo itself has the following types of carnivores: bears, wolves, hyenas, lions, lynxes, and tigers.\r\n\r\nWe have been actively supporting the zoo since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, and as part of the project we have already bought food for the animals for UAH 14,080, but this aid is not enough, the animals need our support.\r\n\r\nThank you for your concern!",

Sakura trees are one of the most beautiful and symbolic trees in the world. They are known for their unique appearance and floral beauty. Sakura flowers symbolize beauty and youth, and their color can vary from white to deep pink. Sakuras are also known for their very short bloom, which makes this phenomenon even more precious and beautiful.\r\n\r\nSakura Alley in Vidradny Park will create an unparalleled atmosphere for relaxation and walks in the natural environment. It will become a new pearl of the city and will be a decoration for photo sessions and rest with family and friends.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we invite everyone to join this important project and support the creation of a cherry blossom alley in Vidradny Park. The collected funds will be used to buy trees. Kyivzelenbud will help with planting and care.",

The club has been operating for over 24 years, despite a lack of funding or other current challenges. Even since the outbreak of full-scale hostilities in 2022, the club's staff has continued to communicate with and support its beneficiaries. Moreover, taking into account the new needs of its audience, the number of social services at the club is increasing: psychological services, assistance in minor repairs of apartments, etc.\r\n\r\nThe main reason why the elderly come to the club is to feel a sense of belonging to society and peers, to share their joy or problems, to find solutions, and to help another person. In the club, the elderly do not feel lonely and unwanted. Here, they continue to be individuals with a lot of life experience.\r\n\r\nFor a long time, the project “A Place of Communication for Lonely Old People” has been self-financed. Despite all the difficulties, our foundation does not plan to close the project, given its great social importance.\r\n\r\nFor the regular operation of the club, funds are needed every month to rent the premises and pay utility bills, to buy goodies for tea parties, and to pay salaries to project staff. As part of this project, we traditionally raise funds to pay for rent and utilities. Of course, we ask you to join the fundraiser and make a charitable donation to implement important social assistance for the elderly. We sincerely believe that together we can give the elderly a sense of joy and unity. Thank you all for your support!",

She still has a difficult and long way ahead of her, but we believe she is capable of more. Her diagnoses include brain developmental disorder, symptomatic epilepsy, and delayed psycho-linguistic and statokinetic development.\r\n\r\nDaryna needs constant rehabilitation: physical therapy, sensory integration, lessons with a speech therapist, swimming pool, etc. Classes with qualified specialists are already yielding excellent results, improving the girl's physical and emotional state. There is progress, and it is important for her development!\r\n\r\nHowever, all this requires a lot of money, which the family does not have at the moment. Your contribution is a chance for Daryna to be like other children: to play, walk and learn.\r\n\r\nDo not be indifferent, help our little heroine to get a chance for a happy childhood! Each of your contributions is an important step towards helping Daryna take her first independent steps, enjoy every day and be healthy.\r\n\r\nPlease support Daryna!

It was hot summer weather outside, so they didn't pay the necessary attention to Olia's thirst, which was making her very thirsty. The girl had a good appetite and a good mood, which did not raise suspicions of illness. But a strange thing happened – Olia was too fond of sweets and ate a lot of them. A blood sugar test suggested by the doctor revealed a very high reading. Unfortunately, the fears came true: the girl was diagnosed with insulin-dependent diabetes. And then – as with all children with this diagnosis – resuscitation, drips, tears.\r\n\r\nThen the family was in trouble again. Again, because Olia's brother had been suffering from diabetes for several years. The girl became the second sick child of her parents. It was more difficult for her mother with her daughter than with her son. The little girl did not understand her illness, why she could not eat when she wanted and as much as she wanted, why she constantly needed to pierce her fingers to measure glucose levels and inject insulin. But time goes on, children grow up. Olia is already graduating from the third grade. Doctors assured her mother that diabetes is a way of life. But her mother believes that diabetes is a hard day's work that requires attention around the clock. The woman has no medical education, but over the years she has become an endocrinologist for her children.\r\n\r\nThe parents work hard to provide their children with everything they need. But it is difficult to support one child with diabetes. With two children, it is even more difficult. Unfortunately, it is not always possible to provide Olia with everything she needs, including the means to constantly monitor her sugar levels. That's why her mother is asking for help.",
